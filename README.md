# rss-email-subscription

Say we have a blog and a list of email addresses. We want an app that would watch the blogâ€™s RSS feed, and would email the new blog posts to every email address. I have seen this called rss-to-email in other places.

## The 2 pieces

1. `src/rss-checking/main.ts`: an app that fetches the given RSS feed, and records the new items; run with `make run-rss-checking`.
2. `src/email-sending/main.ts`: an app that knows the email addresses, and delivers the new items; run with `make run-email-sending`; SMTP config comes from envars.

Somehow I managed to gray-box TDD everything following the [advice from GeePaw Hill][0].
