Conventions

- Keep changes scoped and minimal.
- Add a co-author trailer on agent-made commits:
  - `Co-authored-by: Codex CLI <codex-cli@users.noreply.github.com>`
- Format examples as fenced code blocks with the correct language tag
  (e.g., `dockerfile` for Dockerfile instructions, `bash` for shell).
- When proposing multiple options, prefer a numbered list
  so they are easier to scan and reference.
