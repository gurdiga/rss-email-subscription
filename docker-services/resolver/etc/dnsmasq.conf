# Set the facility to which dnsmasq will send syslog entries, this
# defaults to DAEMON, and to LOCAL0 when debug mode is in operation. If
# the facility given contains at least one '/' character, it is taken to
# be a filename, and dnsmasq logs to the given file, instead of syslog.
# If the facility is '-' then dnsmasq logs to stderr. (Errors whilst
# reading configuration will still go to syslog, but all output from a
# successful startup, and all output whilst running, will go exclusively
# to the file.) When logging to a file, dnsmasq will close and reopen
# the file when it receives SIGUSR2. This allows the log file to be
# rotated without stopping dnsmasq.
